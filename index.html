        <h3> Early Life,  

          I was born in Sjukhuset Skövde in 2nd november 2003, as the years flied through i became a
          gamer at 15 playing games such as League of Legends and Counter strike and thats where i got
          most of my interest for computer and stuff like that came from.</h3>     
       
        <h3>I have recently starting to watch a new series called House of the Dragon and i have
          really become obsessed with it, and i found out that the series is based on real life
          books from the collection called A song of ice and fire which consists of 8 books, I
          even found out that the series even have its own wiki page.
